          <h1>Loans: an interactive data visualisation</h1>
          <h2 class="sub">A project for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree</h2>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            When we think about loans, we often think about the economic and societal problems surrounding it.
            We think about interest rates, the general probability of defaulting or bankruptcy. We think about the
            economic implications for countries, but not so much about the actual people getting these loans, and the mundane things
            they get their loans for: home improvement, a motorcycle, or maybe even a surgery. The following is an attempt to show the people
            behind the loans: the jobs that they have and the reasons for getting a loan. It is an interactive visualisation using loan data set
            from Prosper.

          <p>
            I used R to do some data wrangling on the original data set. I only used data from after 2009 for two reasons: there has been
             a change in documenting the credit rating in the data set, and secondly I believe that the world has changed a lot during the
             crisis of 2008/2009, especially when it comes to the financial decisions that people make. I wanted to use data that reflects the
             way people think about money nowadays. Next, I started with a concept drawing of the data visualisation I was thinking of. I first
             wanted to make a scatter plot with dots representing all the individuals so you could clearly see that these are all
             unique people with different jobs, different types of loans, and different ratings. I quickly realised that although the
             idea was interesting, plotting 80.000 dots was not going to make a lot of sense.

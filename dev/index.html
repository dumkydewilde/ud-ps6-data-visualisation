          <h1>Loans: an interactive data visualisation</h1>
          <h2 class="sub">A project for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree</h2>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            When we think about loans, we often think about the economic and societal problems surrounding it.
            We think about interest rates, the general probability of defaulting or bankruptcy. We think about the
            economic implications for countries, but not so much about the actual people getting these loans, and the mundane things
            they get their loans for: home improvement, a motorcycle, or maybe even a surgery. The following is an attempt to show the people
            behind the loans: the jobs that they have and the reasons for getting a loan. It is an interactive visualisation using loan data set
            from Prosper.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used R to do some data wrangling on the original data set (you can <a href="https://github.com/dumkydewilde/ud-ps6-data-visualisation/blob/master/dev/data/loan_data_exploration.Rmd">find
              the RMD file on github)</a>. I only used data from after 2009 for two reasons: there has been
             a change in documenting the credit rating in the data set, and secondly I believe that the world has changed a lot during the
             crisis of 2008/2009, especially when it comes to the financial decisions that people make. I wanted to use data that reflects the
             way people think about money nowadays. Next, I started with a concept drawing of the data visualisation I was thinking of. I first
             wanted to make a scatter plot with dots representing all the individuals so you could clearly see that these are all
             unique people with different jobs, different types of loans, and different ratings. I quickly realised that although the
             idea was interesting, plotting 80.000 dots was not going to make a lot of sense.

          <h3>Approach and fine tuning</h3>
            <p>
              I started out with just a concept, a drawing to visualise my thoughts. I then discussed this with a friend to get some
              preliminary feedback before actually starting to develop it and discussing the first version with some more people.
              This first feedback made me realise that putting 80.000 points in a plot was going to get messy and not
              convey the messsage of showing the lives of the people behind the loans. Next, I
              decided to use a horizontal bar chart to focus on the jobs that people have because it is a characteristic that people recognize,
              meaning that loans are not just numbers on a paper, but actual people that can have the same jobs as you and I. The bar chart is
              nice because it shows all the different jobs and the diversity, but it was lacking something. The feedback I got was that it
              was still not very interactive and that it was hard to get a feel for the different characteristics of the people behind the
              loans. To address that problem I decided to add some interactivity to the graphs by making it stacked and
              allowing people to select how it is stacked by a simple radio button. This interactivity has the added benefit of creating
              a feeling that you can really see the people behind the loan because you can understand their different characteristics.
            </p>

          <h2>The visualisation</h2>
          <h3>So you're getting a loan? What's your job?</h3>
          <p>
            Of course being able to pay back your loan is an important part of getting a loan, and that will often mean having a job.
            The interesting thing about the data from Prosper is that it tells us very specifically about the sector someone is working in.
            That means that we can not only see in which sector people get the most loans in absolute terms, but also how the underlying
            characteristics differ. Are people self-employed or do they work part time perhaps? What credit rating do they have? What is
            purpose of the loan? This graph shows you the details that give you some insight into the diversity of people taking out a loan,
            and the variety of reasons to do so. Generalistic terms like 'Other' or 'Professional' have intentionally been left out to let
            you focus on the characteristics, and for the graph below we'll only show you elements with an n (number of people) higher than
            20 to not get lost in the details.

          <h3>And tell me: What are you using the money for?</h3>
          <p>
            Behind every loan is a specific story. There is a reason why people need a loan. The following diagram is an attempt to
            show the diversity in reasons and purposes of loans. When we strip away the large bulk of loans for 'debt consolidation'
            and 'other' we see how many of those loans go to mundane things like 'home improvement', or the not so mundane things like getting a
            wedding ring. Click the legend to turn parts on or off.

          <h3>Feedback: Joanne (27)</h3>
          <p>
            I asked Joanne a couple of questions on both the concept version and version 1. Questions like: 'What do you notice?', 'What is the takeaway?' 'Are things unclear, or is their anything you don't understand?'
            Joanne's response on the concept was that it was quite unclear. She didn't really took away anything other than that it was just a lot of different points mashed together. When I explained the concept of
            using individuals as points and thereby showing the individual behind a loan she liked that concept, but thought it didn't come through in the visualisation. She liked the version 1 better, although her commentary
            was that it was too much of a list and still missed some interaction or understanding of who these people are and what they do. I decided to shorten the list a bit by leaving out the elements with an n < 20.
          </p>
          <h3>Feedback: Hans (70)</h3>
          <p>
            I asked Hans similar questions as Joanne, and he had a look at version 1. His response was that it was interesting to see the differences between which jobs took out the most loans, but he noticed that
            the graph lacked a kind of exploratory part. There wasn't really much to interact with. Althought the jobs part was somewhat interesting, he didn't really get the concept of the people and their characteristics
            behind the loans.

          <h3>Feedback: Sophie (27)</h3>
          <p>
            Sophie had similar responses to Joanne and Hans, but there was one thing she noticed that I thought was interesting. When we talked about the data set she mentioned that she thought it interesting that you could
            find out what people had used their loan for. She thought it was interesting to dive in even deeper and see things like: 'How many people with this kind of job took out a loan for a wedding ring?' Her comments
            inspired me to also look more into the purpose of the loan as it showed the 'human' side of the data set. I decided to use a pie (ring) chart to show how different purposes relate to each other and allow users
            to play around with that so they can see how many more loans for wedding rings than loans for home improvement are taken out for example.
